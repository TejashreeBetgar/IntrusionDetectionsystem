# Intrusion Detection System Using Machine Learning

Welcome to the **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** project, where cutting-edge machine learning models are utilized to detect and mitigate network security threats. This project is designed to simplify intrusion detection using advanced algorithms and accessible tools.

---

## üöÄ Overview
This project leverages machine learning techniques to build a robust Intrusion Detection System that can:
- Detect anomalies in network traffic.
- Distinguish between normal activities and potential cyber-attacks.
- Minimize false positives and negatives for reliable security.

### Key Features:
- Utilizes the **NSL-KDD dataset** for better accuracy and reduced redundancy.
- Incorporates dimensionality reduction with **PCA** for efficient computation.
- Models: **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **SVM**.
- Tools used: **Google Colab**, **Weka**, and Python libraries.
